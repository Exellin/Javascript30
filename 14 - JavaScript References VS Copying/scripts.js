// however what happens when we update that array?
console.log(players, team);

// now here is the problem!

// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
const team2 = players.slice();

// one way

// or create a new array and concat the old one in
const team3 = [].concat(players);

// or use the new ES6 Spread
const team4 = [...players];

// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

// with Objects
const person = {
  name: 'Wes Bos',
  age: 80
}

// and think we make a copy:
const captain = person;
captain.number = 99;

// how do we take a copy instead?
const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99})

// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
const captain3 = {...person};

// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
